R is a programming language which is especially powerful for statistics, data exploration, and visualization. It is open source and free to use, and has a large and active community of users.

**RTromsø** is a series of meet-ups and workshops for R users at UiT, the Arctic University of Norway where we can share knowledge and experiences, and together learn more about R.
