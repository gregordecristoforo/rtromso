# RTromsø, the R user group a [UiT](https://uit.no)

R is a programming language which is especially powerful for statistics, data
exploration, and visualization.  It is open source and free to use, and has a
large and active community of users.

**RTromsø** is a series of meet-ups and workshops for R users at UiT, the
Arctic University of Norway where we can share knowledge and experiences, and
together learn more about R.
