  - Pizza will be sponsored by the [research software engineering (RSE) group](https://research-software.uit.no/) and the IT department at UiT.
  - The goal for this first meeting is to get to know each other, discuss what we want to get out of the group, and plan future meetings.
  - For each meeting we will try to offer something for complete beginners but
    also share some tool or technique that is useful for more experienced
    coders.
